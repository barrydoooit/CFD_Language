It is better to run this project in a integrated IDE, such as intellij IDEA, for that the compilation of Java classes would be of a huge amount of work.
The input files are stored in the folder 'input files'.
To run the project, please run the main function in the src/Draw2021/MytTest.java file. The input file could be changed at line 19, or you could just copy codes to run into input files/Copycodehere.txt by default.
Wish you a nice day!
Best regards,
Barry DING
